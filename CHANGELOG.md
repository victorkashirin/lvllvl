# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.496.0 - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Replaced the PHP build scripts with a Node.js ESM build using Terser and
  html-minifier-terser.
- Added a Vite development server with source watching and automatic reload via
  `npm run dev`.
- The build now recreates `dist/` so deleted source assets cannot remain in the
  deployment output.
- Removed generated `dist/` output from version control.
- GitHub Pages now installs Node dependencies, builds, and verifies the site before
  deployment.

### Fixed

- Include the dynamically loaded Ace editor themes in the deployment output.
- Exclude macOS `.DS_Store` metadata from generated files.
